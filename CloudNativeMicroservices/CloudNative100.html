<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the first of several labs that are part of the <strong>Oracle Public Cloud DevOps Cloud Native Microservices workshop.</strong> This workshop will walk you through the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for a Cloud Native project that will create and use several Microservices.</p>
<p>You will take on 3 Personas during the workshop. The <strong>Project Manager Persona</strong> will create the projects, add tasks and features to be worked on, and assign tasks to developers.  The Project Manager will then start the initial sprint. The Java Developer persona will develop a new twitter feed service that will allow for retrieval and filtering of twitter data. The <strong>JavaScript Developer</strong> persona will develop a new Twitter Marketing UI that will display the twitter data to allow for analysis.  During the workshop, you will get exposure to Oracle Developer Cloud Service and Oracle Application Container Cloud Service.</p>

<p>Oracle Developer Cloud Service provides a complete development platform that streamlines team development processes and automates software delivery. The integrated platform includes an issue tracking system, agile development dashboards, code versioning and review platform, continuous integration and delivery automation, as well as team collaboration features such as wikis and live activity stream. With a rich web based dashboard and integration with popular development tools, Oracle Developer Cloud Service helps deliver better applications faster.</p>

<h2 id="add-team-members-owners-to-the-project">Add Team Members (Owners) to the Project</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As previously mentioned, <strong><em>if you are not allowed to have multiple users in your Corporate or Trial accounts, you will skip step 4.</em></strong> When in subsequent steps/labs you are asked to log in as different users responsible for different roles, you will physically perform the tasks as the same user, but you should mentally assume the role of a different persona.</p>

<h1 id="create-agile-board">Create Agile Board</h1>
<h2 id="create-agile-board-and-initial-sprint">Create Agile Board and Initial Sprint</h2>
<p>Before you start using the Agile methodology in Oracle Developer Cloud Service, it is important that you know the following key components of the Agile page.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board</strong> – A Board is used to display and update issues of the project. When you create a Board, you associate it with an Issue Query. The Board shows Issues returned by the Query.<br />
You can either use a Board created by a team member, or create your own Board. You can create as many Boards as you like.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint</strong> – A Sprint is a short duration (usually, a week or two) during which your team members try to implement a product component.<br />
You add the product component related issues to a Sprint. When you start working on a product component, you start (or activate) the related Sprints. To update issues using a Sprint, you must first activate the Sprint and add the Sprint to the Active Sprints view.</li>
<li><strong>Backlog view</strong> – Lists all Issues returned by the Board’s Query. The view also displays all active and inactive Sprints of the Board, and the sprints from other Boards that contain Issues matching the Board’s Query.<br />
Each Sprint lists issues that are added to it. The Backlog section (the last section of the Backlog page) lists all open issues that are not part of any Sprint yet. The Backlog view does not show the resolved and closed Issues.</li>
<li><strong>Active Sprints view</strong> – Lists all active Sprints of the Board and enables you to update an Issue status simply by dragging and dropping it to the respective status columns.</li>
<li><strong>Reports view</strong> – select the Burndown Chart tab to display the amount of work left to do in a Sprint or use the Sprint Report tab to list open and completed Issues of a Sprint.</li>
</ul>
